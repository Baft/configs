    -a [oldpassword]: The -a flag allows you to supply the old password as part of the request on the command line.
    -A: This flag is an alternative to the -a flag that will prompt you for the old password when the command is entered.
    -t [oldpasswordfile]: This flag can be used instead of the above to read the old password from a file.
    -s [newpassword]: The -s flag is used to supply the new password on the command line.
    -S: This variant of the -s flag will prompt you for the new password when the command is entered.
    -T [newpasswordfile]: This flag can be used instead of the above to read the new password from a file.

######################## Changing the Password in the Config DIT

Now, we can edit the file to construct a valid LDIF command to change the password. Open the file we've been writing to:

nano ~/newpasswd.ldif

It should look something like this:
~/newpasswd.ldif

dn: olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
olcRootDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
olcRootPW: {SSHA}ncCXAJ5DjfRWgxE9pz9TUCNl2qGQHQT3

{SSHA}lieJW/YlN5ps6Gn533tJuyY6iRtgSTQw

You could possibly have multiple values depending on if your LDAP server has more than one DIT. If that is the case, use the olcRootDN value to find the correct account that you wish to modify. Delete the other dn, olcRootDN, olcRootPW triplets if there are any.

After you've confirmed that the olcRootDN line matches the account you are trying to modify, comment it out. Below it, we will add two lines. The first one should specify changetype: modify, and the second line should tell LDAP that you are trying to replace: olcRootPW. It will look like this:
~/newpasswd.ldif

dn: olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
#olcRootDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: olcRootPW
olcRootPW: {SSHA}ncCXAJ5DjfRWgxE9pz9TUCNl2qGQHQT3

{SSHA}lieJW/YlN5ps6Gn533tJuyY6iRtgSTQw

Now, delete the hash that is in the olcRootPW line and replace it with the one you generated below. Remove any extraneous lines. It should now look like this:
~/newpasswd.ldif

dn: olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
#olcRootDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: olcRootPW
olcRootPW: {SSHA}lieJW/YlN5ps6Gn533tJuyY6iRtgSTQw

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Now, we can apply the change by typing:

    sudo ldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f ~/newpasswd.ldif

This will change the administrative password within the cn=config DIT.

######################## Changing the Password in the Normal DIT

This has changed the password for the entry within the administrative DIT. However, we still need to modify the entry within the regular DIT. Currently both the old and new passwords are valid. We can fix this by modifying the regular DIT entry using our new credentials.

Open up the LDIF file again:

    nano ~/newpasswd.ldif

Replace the value in the dn: line with the RootDN value that you commented out earlier. This entry is our new target for the password change. We will also need to change both occurrences of olcRootPW with userPassword so that we are modifying the correct value. When you are finished, the LDIF file should look like this:

[output ~/newpasswd.ldif]
dn: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: userPassword
userPassword: {SSHA}lieJW/YlN5ps6Gn533tJuyY6iRtgSTQw

Save and close the file.

Now, we can modify the password for that entry by binding to it using the new password we set in the config DIT. You will need to bind to the RootDN entry to perform the operation:

    ldapmodify -H ldap:// -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f ~/newpasswd.ldif

You will be prompted for the new password you set in the config DIT. Once authenticated, the password will be changed, leaving only the new password for authentication purposes.
